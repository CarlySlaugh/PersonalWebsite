    <p><span>October 9, 2021 me and my family got to go on a hunt in Utah. This hunt was a once in a lifetime hunt. My mom drew an elk tag that she has been wanting since she was a little girl. We planned this trip out and got all of our things packed and traveled to Utah to get our hunt on. Since we lived in Idaho we had to travel 8 hours to get to where we were going. We started hunting and searching early Saturday morning and it lasted until October 14, when we found the elk we wanted. Looking around the mountains seeing lots of elk and deer, we found the one we wanted and started the hunt for it. We shot the elk around 4:00 on October 13. The elk wouldn't stop running, and we were losing daylight. We suddenly realized that the elk had gone into private property and we knew we couldn't go in and get him without permission. The blood trail was strong, but we couldn't keep going with the loss of daylight,and the condition we were in. We went back to the cabin to get a hold of a fishing game officer who had to come meet us the next morning in order to go get the elk. 6:30 rolled around and we got up bright and early to go back on the hunt. The officers stayed with us until we got the elk out of the property. My mom, My uncle, My step dad, and my brother-in-law all went to trail the elk. Walking almost 6 miles, they saw the elk had crossed into Colorado. After almost an hour's wait, we got a hold of the colorado fishing game and they gave us permission to cross the colorado border and get the elk. 10:15 three shots were fired and they came on the radio and told us that the elk was down. Me, my uncle, my sister, my grandpa, and my cousin hiked in to get the elk and pack it out. Walking in the snow, hands freezing, all bundled up, we got the elk and went back to the truck to head to the cabin where we would hang the meat and hangout for the rest of the day. This hunt was one of the best experiences in my life, and it will be a hunt that I will always remember.</span> </p>
