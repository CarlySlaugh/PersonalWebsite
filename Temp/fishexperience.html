    <p> <span>In June of 2021, me and my family had the opportunity to go on a fishing/rafting trip down the John Day river in oregon. This is a rafting trip that we go on every year. This year we went with me, my mom, my step dad, my little sister, and my grandma. This was one of the funnest year round trip that we go on. We float down this river in 2 pontoon boats, one's name is barney, and the other one is blue dart. Since the water was so low on this trip, we were catching so many fish. As we were floating down the river, I decided that I wanted to fish. Sitting on the front of the boat i casted the pole and slowly started reeling in. I felt the fish biting, I pulled up and yelled "FISH ON!" and i knew this was a big fish. I realized it, but couldn't grab a hold of it in front of the boat . We went to shore and parked the boat and I brought the fish to land. I unhooked my life from its mouth and we put it in the cooler for dinner. We cooked the fish later that night and cooked it and ate it with the catfish my sister caught also. This trip was so fun and definitely worth the sun burns that were formed. </span> </p>
